## **About**
Can you imagine a world devoid of remote controls? It's a challenging thought, isn't it? The world has witnessed remarkable advancements, all driven by the concept of communication—the transmission of information and intention among one another. This is how televisions made their grand debut in the entertainment industry, where remote-controls transmitted the intention of users to their televisions.

This is where KomiX comes into play: A simple TV;remote-control relationship software, where commands on the host computer are executed through your phone.
